# Open Source Policy Examples and Templates

Companies using open source software often create a company-wide policy to ensure that all staff is informed of how to use open source (especially in products). An open source policy exists to maximize the impact and benefit of using open source, and to ensure that any technical, legal or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated.

These templates and examples are simply for you to reuse and learn from.
